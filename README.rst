A simple package to help sort non-English names.

* Free software: BSD 2-Clause License

Installation
============

::

    pip install anglicize

You can also install the in-development version with::

    pip install https://github.com/rciorba/python-anglicize/archive/master.zip


Documentation
=============

This library provides one function, which takes a string and substitutes characters.

To use::

    # call the function directly:
    anglicize("Łukasz") == "Lukasz"

    # or use it to sort a list:
    sorted(["Ana", "Łukasz", "Zack"], key=anglicize) == ["Ana", "Łukasz", "Zack"]

    # there we go, that's much better than this:
    sorted(["Ana", "Łukasz", "Zack"]) == ["Ana", "Zack", "Łukasz"]

Rationale
=========

The purpose of this library is to help you sort non-English names writen in Latin-based alphabets.

Different languages have wildly different rules for sorting, for example ``Ö`` comes after ``Z`` in
Finnish but after ``O`` in Hungarian. The approach taken here is to treat visually similar letters
the same, so basically ``ÖÔÓÒṌṎ`` (and others) should all become ``O``.

Handling letters that have little similarity to A-Z
===================================================

The German ß is the main issue here. I chose to handle it like an S, mostly because it's different
enough from B (the most similar visually) and because it's well known as a version of S to most
Europeans.

Contributing
============

Do you know a language written in a Latin alphabet and want to check it's correctly handled? Have a
look in ``tests/test_anglicize.py``. If the language is there please check all "special" letters are
handled. This list has been mostly compiled off of Wikipedia, so I would not be surprised to hear
about errors :)

You can either make the changes and submit a PR or just create an issue mentioning
- language
- characters which need handling

Development
===========

To run tests for all Python environments run::

    tox
